RTS Colony – Project Bootstrap Kit
=================================

Included:
- context.md (Paste into new ChatGPT Workspace or keep in /docs)
- Usage:
    1. Commit this file and docs/context.md to your repo.
    2. In any new ChatGPT Workspace, paste the contents of context.md at the start.
    3. Use the GitHub connector so ChatGPT can read your code and generate git patches.

This kit exists to:
- Keep your AI development workflow consistent.
- Make it easy to onboard new environments (PC, phone, new workspace).
- Document the expectations for how ChatGPT should collaborate on this project.
