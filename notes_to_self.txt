I'm going to convert everything to use Mysql.
Because Mysql always seems to work no matter what version of Laravel I'm using, it will work with any verion of PHP and any version of Laravel.

Started a board to track my thoughts and progress.

I have an idea but I want to get this project working first then try this:
  1. I have a done an assignment a long time ago that creates a NodeJS server with API end points that save todo items.
  2. Those todo items save into a RethinkDB.
  3. I want to simply convert it to Maps and Tiles.

I like RethinkDB and maybe I can use this in the future

Must get MongoDB working. Eventually when I move to doing this on other computers I'll make sure the
docker-compose file does most of this for me

Mr. A.I. says:
Added a dynamic Next Step button to editor.blade.php 
that appears based on the current MapStatus state and
links to the appropriate next processing route.
Mapping covers all existing constants through water processing.
No other code altered.

Summary of mapping:

CREATED_EMPTY / CELL_PROCESSING_STARTED → step1
CELL_PROCESSING_FINNISHED → step2
TILE_PROCESSING_STARTED → step2
TILE_PROCESSING_STOPPED → tree step3 (runThirdStep)
TREE_FIRST_STEP → treeStep2
TREE_2ND_COMPLETED → treeStep3
TREE_3RD_STARTED / TREE_GEN_COMPLETED → step4 (water)
If you add new states later (e.g., post-water or mountain completion), just extend the $stateToNext array.

Let me know if you’d like:

Auto-advance (queue jobs instead of manual clicks)
A disabled state indicator while a step is running
Integration with a lock/status poll to hide the button mid-process
Ready for next instruction.
