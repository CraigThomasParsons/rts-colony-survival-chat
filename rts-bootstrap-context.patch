+# RTS Colony – Permanent Project Context
+
+PROJECT: Medieval / RTS Colony Survival Game  
+TECH STACK:
+- Backend: PHP 8+ (Laravel Framework)  
+- Frontend: Livewire  
+- Database: MySQL  
+- Optional: Redis (future real-time sync), WebSockets  
+- Tooling: GitHub Connector (ChatGPT reads repo + produces git patches)  
+
+CORE GAME FEATURES:
+- Procedural map generation (noise-based, scatter resource clusters)
+- Resource nodes: wood, stone, gold
+- Persistent Tiles + Map + ResourceNode models  
+- Workers:
+    - Inventory system
+    - Harvesting cycles (carry capacity, travel → harvest → return → dropoff)
+    - Pathfinding (A*, weighted terrain, diagonal optional)
+    - Fatigue, state machine, job priorities (future)
+- Buildings:
+    - Construction progress, required resources, worker participation  
+- World State:
+    - Fully persisted in MySQL
+    - Simulation runs via Laravel service/tick loop
+- Multiplayer (eventual):
+    - Shared persistent world
+    - Cooperative colony play  
+- Future expansions:
+    - Underground map layers
+    - Road auto-routing
+    - Rust TUI client
+    - Selenium / AI players for testing
+
+AI DEVELOPMENT RULES (IMPORTANT):
+1. Always produce unified git patches (.diff) for modifications unless user asks for full files.
+2. When creating a new file, always output the entire file.
+3. Follow Laravel best practices:
+    - Models in app/Models
+    - Services in app/Services
+    - Livewire components in app/Http/Livewire
+    - Console Commands in app/Console/Commands
+4. Maintain compatibility with existing project structure at all times.
+5. Provide clean code with:
+    - PHPDoc blocks
+    - Readable functions
+    - Clear naming conventions
+6. Before major refactors or architecture changes, ask clarifying questions.
+7. Assume the world state must always remain persistent and deterministic.
+
+GIT WORKFLOW RULES:
+- ChatGPT generates feature-specific patches.
+- User applies patches using:
+    git apply patch.diff
+- Feature branches follow:
+    feat/*
+    fix/*
+    refactor/*
+    docs/*
+
+GOAL:
+Maintain a consistent development environment where ChatGPT acts as an AI co-developer for the RTS Colony Survival game.

+RTS Colony – Project Bootstrap Kit
+=================================
+
+Included:
+- context.md (Paste into new ChatGPT Workspace or keep in /docs)
+- Usage:
+    1. Commit this file and docs/context.md to your repo.
+    2. In any new ChatGPT Workspace, paste the contents of context.md at the start.
+    3. Use the GitHub connector so ChatGPT can read your code and generate git patches.
+
+This kit exists to:
+- Keep your AI development workflow consistent.
+- Make it easy to onboard new environments (PC, phone, new workspace).
+- Document the expectations for how ChatGPT should collaborate on this project.
